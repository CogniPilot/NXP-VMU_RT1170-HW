# VMU RT117x
## This is an open reference design for a CogniPilot [Cerebri Vehicle Management Unit](https://github.com/CogniPilot/cerebri).

VMU-RT1170 is a "Vehicle Management Unit" based on the general [i.MX RT1170 family of processors](https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-microcontrollers/i-mx-rt-crossover-mcus/i-mx-rt1170-crossover-mcu-dual-core-arm-cortex-m7-and-cortex-m4-operating-up-to-1-ghz:i.MX-RT1170) and can be found in Zephyr boards as [vmu_rt1170](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/arm/vmu_rt1170/doc/index.html).

- The i.MX RT1176 is currently constrained on VMU-RT1170 by the PAB connector standard. The [PAB standard](https://github.com/pixhawk/Pixhawk-Standards/blob/master/DS-010%20Pixhawk%20Autopilot%20Bus%20Standard.pdf) was already revised to allow for extra PWM from the i.MX RT1176 and allows potential elimination of the IO co-processor that is on the VxX carrier board. Additionally there is a 3rd CAN port available. *In the future look for a revised VxX7 carrier board which makes use of these new signals on the PAB.*

- Given the i.MX RT1176 is currently constrained on the current VMU-RT1170, we will look into future collaboration on a "chip down" design that takes advantage of all the extra IP and peripherals such as the camera and vision pipeline that are currently unused on this chip. This is planned to go by the name VMU-RT1176 as it would not be interchangeable with other i.MX RT117x family chips.
